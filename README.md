# Mean Stack Task Manager App

This Task Manager App is built using the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, Node.js). It allows users to create lists and related tasks within those lists. Users must sign up using their email and password, and sessions expire requiring re-login with the same credentials.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone [repository-url]
```

2. **Install dependencies:**
Navigate to the project root directory and run:

```
npm install
```
This command will install dependencies for the API, Frontend, and default root.

3. **Run the project:**
Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the project by running:

```
npm run start
```
This will start the server and launch the application.


## Usage

1. Sign Up:
Upon launching the application, users will be prompted to sign up using their email and password.

2. Log In:
After signing up, users can log in using their credentials. Sessions will expire, requiring re-login with the same credentials.

Once logged in, users can create lists and add tasks to those lists.

4. Manage Tasks:
Users can mark tasks as completed, delete tasks, or edit task details.

5. Manage Lists:
Users can rename lists, delete lists, or reorder lists as needed.

6. Logout:
Users can logout of their session when finished.
